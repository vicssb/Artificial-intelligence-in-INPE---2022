## Analysis of statistical data from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites for land cover and land use classification in the Amazon region
 
Land use and land cover information are of high importance for a well-structured society, as they help environmental management and agricultural development agencies to identify regions of deforestation and advancing urbanization, as well as natural areas that must be protected. The MapBiomas project uses satellite images and information technology to process and classify the Earth's coverage, informing and making available the transformations in the Brazilian territory annually. The most recent version made available by the project, called collection 6, uses statistical data in different wave frequencies, captured by the LANDSAT satellite instruments, and produces a classification with an accuracy of approximately 97% for the study region. This work aims at the exploratory analysis of statistical attributes of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites in order to analyze the possibility of classifying the use and land cover, in a specific region, through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), using data from collection 6 of MapBiomas as a reference parameter, which would allow the monitoring of changes in a shorter period of time.
